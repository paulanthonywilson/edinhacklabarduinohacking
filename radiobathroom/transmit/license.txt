/* Sleep Demo Serial
 * -----------------
 * Example code to demonstrate the sleep functions in an Arduino.
 *
 * use a resistor between RX and pin2. By default RX is pulled up to 5V
 * therefore, we can use a sequence of Serial data forcing RX to 0, what
 * will make pin2 go LOW activating INT0 external interrupt, bringing
 * the MCU back to life
 *
 * there is also a time counter that will put the MCU to sleep after 10 secs
 *
 * NOTE: when coming back from POWER-DOWN mode, it takes a bit
 *       until the system is functional at 100%!! (typically <1sec)
